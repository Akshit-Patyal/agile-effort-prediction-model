# Agile Effort Prediction Model

This repository contains an implementation of an Agile Effort Prediction Model. The goal of this project is to estimate the effort required for agile software development tasks using predictive modeling techniques.

## Features

- Predict effort for agile tasks using historical data
- Supports integration with various project management tools
- Customizable model parameters
- Visualization of predictions and model performance

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshit-Patyal/agile-effort-prediction-model.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Refer to the relevant requirements or package files for setup instructions.

3. **Run the model**
   Follow the documentation in this README and the code comments to use and extend the model.

## Usage

- Place your agile project data in the appropriate format (see sample files in the `data/` directory).
- Run the main script to train and predict effort values.
- Explore results and visualizations in the output directories.
